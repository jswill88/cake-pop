# Cake Pop

This application allows you to make music by clicking on different buttons that represent different instruments and notes. You can create songs of different lengths, different chord progressions, and different tempos. By picking different chords, the notes will automatically change in your song to match the chord. You can also make an account where you can sign in to save and update your songs.
